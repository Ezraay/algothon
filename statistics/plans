Make function that tests for trends using moving averages.
Make function that compares different moving averages.
Make function that finds trend lines. Make trendline class perhaps.
Update support function to not remove supports if it is only violated by a very small amount.
    This amount should be dependant on stock price and volatility.
    Only do this check in the final interval since it is in the final interval that buying
    decisions are made with regards to the existance of supports i.e. if support is partially
    violated in the interval you should still probably buy the stock since that support
    technically still exists.
Create unactive support function. Unactive supports are considered relatively less than active
    supports but are still important.
Make identicle functions for resistance.
